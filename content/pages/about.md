Hi! I am **Vishal Sharma,** a Computer Science Undergrad at BML Munjal University. I have been coding since I was in 10th standard (was 15 back then). I started programming as the ability to make computers do things intrigued me, and learnt many things such as Linux Kernel Development, Python even without having any formal education in the field. This interest made me pursue CS in my Undergrads. I am also very fond of Maths and Physics, so if you too like them, we can chat for hours on interesting stuff.

My Skill Set includes Python, Java, C/C++, Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and I am presently working on various other skills to add to this set and also to increase my knowledge.

I have a great fond for MOOCs and have enrolled and successfully completed many. I also follow openly available University course materials on web, especially in Deep Learning, such as CS 224N, CS 231N by Stanford.

Apart from programming, which now is obviously not just my hobby, I have great interest in Reading books(non-fiction), Podcasts, Badminton, Debates and Management Discussions. I have always been interested in building things of my own and thus have an entrepreneurial instinct. So, if you have some product idea, we can definitely discuss it over a cup of tea. I have a great interest in conversing with people on various topics, especially when I have more to learn from the discussion. I am an explorer of knowledge and try to seek knowledge from wherever possible. I do love sharing what I learn though, the main reason why I created this blog.
